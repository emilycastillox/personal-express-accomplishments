## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB

I wanted to have a simple design that was easy to read, responsive, and can find all of the information about me easily. These days, I feel like the simpler the design, the better, I picked green as an accent color so it pops out, but is still minimalistic. 

## Lessons Learned:

I definitely want to keep practicing making simple, well designed websitesas I continue to hone my skills. I think it very important to keep in mind the user's experience when navigating a website, so I will keep this in my mind when building my next projects.

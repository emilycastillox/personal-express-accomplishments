This is an app that uses express on the server side to track your accomplishments to use in a performance reviow, or to track deliverables for interviews and resumes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB

Building this on the serverside, I was able to understand the process more and understood what steps needed to happen to make the app function. The put update here updates the color of the message when you favorite it. 

## Lessons Learned:

This is great experience as I continue building server side apps. I now know different ways of updating or using "put" to change the messages for future projects.
